## Image Classification - Kaggle's Dogs vs. Cats Redux: Kernels Edition üê∂üê±

#### Overview
Welcome to my repository for the "Kaggle's Dogs vs. Cats Redux: Kernels Edition" competition! In this Kaggle challenge, the task is to classify images of dogs and cats accurately. Leveraging deep learning and computer vision techniques, I've developed a solution using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning with ResNet-50v2 and VGG16 models to distinguish between these two adorable animal classes.

#### Dataset
The dataset provided by Kaggle contains a large collection of labeled images of dogs and cats. It includes training and testing sets, making it suitable for supervised learning tasks.

#### Solution Approach
To achieve high accuracy in image classification, I employed CNNs as the foundation for my models. Additionally, I leveraged transfer learning to benefit from the pre-trained ResNet-50v2 and VGG16 models. This approach allowed me to fine-tune the pre-trained models on the current dataset, significantly reducing training time and improving accuracy.
